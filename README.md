**Protocol for systematic review of hypertension codes**

**Review title**
A systematic review of codes used in routinely collected electronic healthcare record data to determine the presence of hypertension

Anticipated start date: 17/04/2023
Anticipated completion date: 27/11/2023

**Review question**
To understand what codelists are being used to define hypertension in research using routinely collected electronic healthcare records.

**Sources to be searched**: MEDLINE and EMBASE
Language: English
Search start: January 1990
Search end: January 2023

**Codelist repositories to be searched**: OpenCodelists, HDR UK Phenotype Library, CPRD@Cambridge, LSHTM Data Compass, QResearch, Oxford-RCGP RSC, Manchester Clinical Codes

**Conditions to be studied**: Hypertension effects 1 in 3 adults. It is important to adjust for hypertension when conducting research using routinely collected healthcare data, as a result it is important to understand how researchers define hypertension using codelists in order to create a core codelist of definitions used in the majority of studies.

**Types of studies to be included**: There are no restrictions on study design

Inclusion criteria:
Studies using electronic healthcare records for research purposes
Studies investigating hypertension

**Data extraction**: All studies titles and abstracts will be reviewed by the primary reviewer for and will be marked for inclusion/ exclusion as necessary. Approximately half of the titles and abstracts will be assessed by a second reviewer. If when compared, there are differences of opinion as to whether a study should be included, a third reviewer may intervene. After this stage, all included publications will be read and assessed by both reviewers, if they are deemed relevant then data will be extracted using a data extraction tool.
Information to be extracted: Title, Publication date, Main condition of interest, EHR database searched, Coding system used
Data to be extracted: Codelists for identification of hypertension

**Risk of bias**: As we are studying methodology rather than results, it is not necessary to carry out a risk of bias assessment. However we do recognise that as not all studies conducted using routinely collected healthcare data are published we may encounter a publication bias.

**Strategy for data synthesis**: Inclusion criteria: Codelists must be publically available
Clinical terminologies to be synthesised: SNOMED CT, ICD10, readcodes (version 2), Clinical Terms Version 3, CPRD medcode id's, ICPC codes, UK BioBank self-diagnosis codes

All codes used in studies to identify hypertension will be recorded using Microsoft Excel. Comparison between codes used in different papers will be narrative, for each coding system the most commonly used codes will be described as core codes to identify hypertension for research using Routinely Collected Healthcare Data. Codelists used to identify hypertension will be displayed in tables highlighting frequency of use.
